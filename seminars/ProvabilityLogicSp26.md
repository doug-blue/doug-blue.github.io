# PHIL 2500 Provability Logic (Spring 2026)
**Instructor:** Doug Blue

**Email:** doug.blue[at]pitt.edu

**Meetings:** Thursdays 10am-12:30pm in CL 1008B

### Description
This course is about formal systems, their limitations, and what those limitations may or may not allow us to
conclude philosophically. We will prove Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems.
Then we will study provability logic, the modal logic in which $\square$ is interpreted as provability in a fixed formal system.
Time permitting, we will discuss efforts to articulate _absolute provability_.

### Requirements

There will be weekly exercises due on Fridays at 5pm via Gradescope.
